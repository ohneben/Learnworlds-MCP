# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project tracks the latest commit on the `main` branch. Security fixes land
there — please make sure you are running the most recent version before
reporting an issue.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | :-------: |
| `main` (latest) | ✅ |
| older commits   | ❌ |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security problems.**

Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub:

1. Open this repository's [**Security** tab](../../security).
2. Click [**Report a vulnerability**](../../security/advisories/new) to start a
   private security advisory.

> If the "Report a vulnerability" button isn't visible, a maintainer needs to
> enable **Private vulnerability reporting** under **Settings → Security**.

Please include:

- a description of the issue and its impact,
- steps to reproduce (a proof of concept if possible), and
- the affected version/commit and your environment.

You'll get an initial response on a best-effort basis. Once a fix is ready it is
released on `main` and the advisory is published.

## Deployment & Hardening Notes

This server bridges an MCP client to the **LearnWorlds public API**. It can read
and write real school data — users, enrollments, payments, courses — so treat it
accordingly:

- **Your API credentials are secrets.** `LEARNWORLDS_API_TOKEN` and
  `LEARNWORLDS_CLIENT_ID` (plus your school's `LEARNWORLDS_BASE_URL`) live in
  `.env`, which is git-ignored — never commit or share them. If the token leaks,
  rotate it in **LearnWorlds admin → Settings → Integrations → Developers (API)**.
- **Credentials never reach the model.** The server injects the bearer token and
  the `Lw-Client` header on every outgoing request; the MCP client (and the LLM
  behind it) only ever sees tool inputs and API responses, never your secrets.
- **The HTTP endpoint is unauthenticated by default**, which is fine for
  localhost-only use (the bundled `docker-compose.yml` binds to `127.0.0.1`). If
  you expose it beyond your machine, set `MCP_SHARED_TOKEN` and require it via an
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Prefer running it behind TLS (a reverse
  proxy) rather than exposing the raw port.
- **Mind the destructive tools.** Eight tools delete data (users, enrollments,
  coupons, seats, and more). They carry `destructiveHint` / non-`readOnlyHint`
  annotations so a well-behaved host can prompt for confirmation — keep that
  confirmation on.
- **Keep the container on a trusted network** and **keep dependencies current**
  (see Dependabot, if enabled).

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.
